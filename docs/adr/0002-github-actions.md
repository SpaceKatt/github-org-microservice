# 0002, GitHub Actions for CI/CD Activities

Date: 2021-07-19

## Context

GitHub Actions provide an environment for performing continuous integration and delivery.

TravisCI has been used by the author for previous projects.

TravisCI has recently changed their free tier offering.

## Decision

GitHub actions will be used for all CI/CD related tasks.

Changes to TravisCI's free tier will likely cause the author to forgo using it in the future.

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

GitHub Actions provide this project with CI/CD muscle.
